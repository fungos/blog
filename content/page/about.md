Hi, my name is Danny Angelo Carminati Grein and I live in Qu√©bec City.

I'm currently a Senior Technology Programmer at [Beenox Inc.](http://beenox.com/)/Activision developing AAA games, you can find a bit more about my professional background over my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dannygrein).

I'm no writter, but I'm trying to get out of my confort zone, consider it before anything else.

This is a personal blog and as such the opinions expressed here represent my own and not those of my employer. My opinions may generally be biased or simple wrong.

This blog is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and is based over the theme [Simple-A](https://themes.gohugo.io/simple-a/).
